                                    &emsp;I am currently in Year 2 of my course, Diploma in Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, working towards a career in Digital Forensics. This course has given me the opportunity to learn and put into practice skills such as web application penetration testing, malware analysis, and more. To deepen my knowledge about my line of study, I have attended webinars about Cyber-Security challenges and future perspectives, and about Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity.
                                    <br />&emsp;Fuelled by my desire to give back to the community, I took part in many service-learning events in NP. For example, in 2021, my classmates and I taught elderly from Yong-en Care Centre to use Canva, as they had expressed interest in learning to use it, and so that we could use our knowledge to help them to adapt to a digitalized world. The same year, I was a member of a Youth Expedition Project preparing refugees from ElShaddai Refugee Learning Centre in Klang, Malaysia for their IGCSE ICT. In my free time, I volunteer in community service events through my school's community service club.
                                    <br />&emsp; An active member of multiple clubs, I am the current Vice President of Operations in my school's interest group, ICT Society, and help organize school events as well as help out for school outreach events.
                                    <br />&emsp;As a result of displaying academic excellence and all-roundedness, I was awarded the NP Scholarship for Year 1 and Year 2, and am a current member of The Christieara Programme. I was also given the opportuity to represent my school at the Pre-University Seminar 2021 and the Polytechnic Forum 2021.

                                    <br />&emsp;Having won both Bronze and Silver in The Queen's Commonwealth Essay and represented my school in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mgs.moe.edu.sg/secondary/others/key-programmes/regional-youth-conference">10th MGS Regional Youth Conference</a>, I displayed my intellectual curiosity and flair for communication.

                                    <h2>Industry Engagement</h2>
                                    <p>To boost my awareness of the cybersecurity industry today and to hear industry experts' perspectives on future advancements in the field, I attended some webinars and increased my knowledge of my industry.</p>

                                    <br /><h4>Cyber-Security challenges and future perspectives</h4>
                                    <img src="images/proof1-cybersecurity challenges and future perspectives.png">
                                    <br /><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/webinar-cyber-security-challenges-and-future-perspectives-tickets-240940017077">Event Page</a>
                                    <p>In this webinar, I gained insight about the importance of cybersecurity in the current landscape, and learned about the different types of projects and measures being taken by companies to inculcate cybersecurity awareness in their employees. The webinar was hosted by projects Cyber-MAR and FORESIGHT, two EU-based projects focused on developing cyber awareness in the maritime sector (Cyber-MAR), aviation, power grid and naval sectors (FORESIGHT). I have a personal interest in the maritime and aviation sectors, so I was interested to find out more about cybersecurity in those sectors, the types of attacks prevalent in those industries today and the actions being taken to combat them. Moreover, with Singapore's recent strategies strengthening cybersecurity in our maritime and aviation sectors, I wanted to find out if there was anything else that Singapore could do in the future to protect our these sectors and our economy better.</p>

                                    <br /><h4>Trailblazing the Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity Discipline</h4>
                                    <img src="images/proof2-aiincybersec.png">
                                    <br /><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/trailblazing-the-artificial-intelligence-for-cybersecurity-discipline-tickets-211163725387">Event Page</a>
                                    <p>I attended this webinar because though I am a cybersecurity student, I have also studied deep learning, and it was interesting to know how the two disciplines could merge. In the webinar, it was highlighted that a lot of cybersecurity tasks are repetitive, which is why there is room for AI in cybersecurity, to take over the repetitive tasks so that efforts can be focused on other tasks. AI is also being used to boost analysis, in measures that were discussed in the webinar. The webinar also covered possible ways to cultivate AI for the cybersecurity discipline in the future, and my key takeaway from this experience is to continue to upskill and familiarise myself with new technology. This is because there are always new technologies being developed that can boost efficiency and accuracy even in tasks in my own field.</p>

                                    <br /><h2>Service Learning</h2>
                                    <p>Service-Learning provided me with the opportunity to apply what I learnt in school to help my community. It also taught me values that come in useful for my everyday life and for when I enter the workforce. In November 2021, I conducted a virtual Service-Learning project with my classmates in conjunction with Yong-en Care Center to teach elderly how to use Canva.</p>
                                    <img src="images/sl-brochure.jpg">
                                    <p>In this project, I was an English teacher, showing and explaining to the beneficiaries the functionalities of the software and guiding them through it. My tasks included guiding them through the steps to create designs on Canva through Zoom, with the help of my fellow classmates (who were teachers with me), making sure everyone understood what was being taught and helping the beneficiaries with any issues they faced. Before the actual event, we also had to create the lesson material, which involved a lot of planning and time management.</p>
                                    <p>We faced many issues on the day itself, some main issues being the difficulty in guiding some beneficiaries who were lost, last-minute changes to the schedule due to time constraints, and sudden changes in the system which caused me to take over a section which I had not prepared to teach. </p>
                                    <p>Despite the issues, the event was deemed a successful one as the beneficiaries were satisfied and had learnt something new at the end of the session, and me and my classmates did too. Personally, I have taken away from this the understanding that it is important to be aware and considerate of the people I am working with, and to be able to adapt to new situations. I also developed my personal values of team management and patience.</p>
